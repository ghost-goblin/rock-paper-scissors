# Rock Paper Scissors Game
## ✊ ✋ ✌️

This JavaScript game is part of the curriculum by the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors).

The game is going to play against the computer with a function called computerPlay that will randomly return either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’.

You can play the game on my [repl](https://repl.it/@ghostgoblin/RockPaperScissor).
