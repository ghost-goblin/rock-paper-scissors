# Rock Paper Scissors Game
## ✊ ✋ ✌️

This JavaScript game is part of the curriculum by the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors).

The game is going to play against the computer with a function called computerPlay that will randomly return either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’.

```js
function playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection) {
  // your code here!
}

const playerSelection = "rock";
const computerSelection = computerPlay();
console.log(playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection));
```
